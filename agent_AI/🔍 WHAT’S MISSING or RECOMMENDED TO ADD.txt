üîç WHAT‚ÄôS MISSING or RECOMMENDED TO ADD
Missing Item	Why it Matters	Recommendation
‚ö†Ô∏è DTO definitions file	While DTOs are described across multiple files, there‚Äôs no single source of truth for them	Create wash-dtos-spec.txt listing all request/response DTOs clearly
‚ö†Ô∏è Validation rules summary	FluentValidation rules exist but aren‚Äôt centralized	Create wash-validation-rules.txt listing rules per DTO (e.g. required fields, max lengths, etc.)
‚ö†Ô∏è Authorization matrix	Not explicitly documented who can access what (e.g. if Admin roles are added later)	Create a short wash-auth-policy.txt defining [Authorize(Roles=...)] for each endpoint
‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling / response codes	Expected errors (e.g. 400 for max active washes, 401 for login fail) are not fully listed	Add a wash-error-codes.txt documenting HTTP codes per endpoint (optional but useful)
‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment/config guide	Not included yet (e.g. how to configure ImagePath, JWT keys, DbContext)	Optional wash-deployment-config.txt or inline notes in Program.cs
üü° ERD diagram (visual)	Helpful for DB devs or external reviewers, not mandatory	Optional: Use a tool to export based on schema, or request one here
